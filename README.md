# Teenytiny Basic Compiler
----
This is my first crack at understanding how compilers work. I have read up on lexers, parsers, and action trees.

I am following this guide on making a *Teenytiny* compiler made by Austin Henley -> https://austinhenley.com/blog/teenytinycompiler1.html

If you want to make your first compiler I encourage you to follow the guide!
